The current ERF is 18%. &nbsp;Republic Services regularly monitors these costs and may change the ERF at Republic Services’ discretion. Your ERF will be combined with your FRF on your invoice.</p>

                        <p>The Recycling Processing Charge (“RPC”) is an enterprise-wide recurring charge imposed on customers receiving recycling services. The RPC is intended to help our businesses recover both direct and indirect costs associated with the processing of materials received at its recycling facilities necessitated by high levels of contamination, strict specifications by purchasers of commodities, and highly fluctuating commodity values. The RPC is determined monthly by cross-referencing <rsx-a href="/cms/documents/Documents/RPCRateTableOCCNov2021_0.pdf" target="_blank" ng-version="13.4.0"><a data-automation-id="rich-text-link" rel="noopener" href="/cms/documents/Documents/RPCRateTableOCCNov2021_0.pdf" target="true">Republic Services’ RPC Table</a></rsx-a> with the lowest US average price per ton for Old Corrugate Containers – Pulp &amp; Paper Index (“OCC-PPI”) as published during the previous month by Fastmarkets RISI PPI Pulp &amp; Paper Week.

                        </ul>
                        <p>The operating subsidiary providing your service will provide containers (in some cases for a rental charge) for your convenience with respect to the collection and on-site storage of your solid waste and recyclable materials. Container delivery and removal fees are intended to offset Republic Services’ operational costs of sending a truck to deliver your container(s) at the start of your service and removing your container(s) when your service terminates, as well as costs related to cleaning, repairs and refurbishment of the containers following your use. Container delivery and removal fees are set by each operating subsidiary and are subject to change at any time at that operating subsidiary’s discretion. Container delivery and removal fees are charged at the operating subsidiary’s prevailing rate at the time of delivery or removal for Invoice-to-Invoice Customers; however, neither your container delivery fee nor your container removal fee will exceed $50 per container.</p>

                        <p>If you fail to pay your invoice on or before its due date, the operating subsidiary providing your service reserves the right to suspend your service until you pay all outstanding invoices. It also reserves the right to charge you a service interruption fee. Service interruption fees are intended to mitigate some of Republic Services’ loss of return on the container assets in the customers’ possession and for the interruption in its business and costs associated with stopping and restarting service. Service interruption fees are charged at the operating subsidiary’s prevailing rate at the time of service interruption for Invoice-to-Invoice Customers; however, your service interruption fee will not exceed $50.</p>

                        <p>If you fail to pay your invoice on or before its due date, the operating subsidiary providing your service reserves the right to charge you a late payment fee. Late payment fees are intended to help Republic Services recover its costs incurred in managing customers’ unpaid accounts. Late payment fees are set by each operating subsidiary and are subject to change at any time at that operating subsidiary’s discretion; however, your late payment fee will not exceed the greater of $5 or up to 10% of the applicable charges, subject to applicable law.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Some services provided by Republic Services (including equipment rental) may be subject to state, local and/or franchise taxes or fees. If applicable, such state, local and/or franchise taxes or fees will be separately itemized on your invoice, collected by the operating subsidiary providing your service and submitted to the appropriate taxing authority and/or franchise authority.</p>

You may also cancel your services at any other time by calling the telephone number on the front of your invoice (or customer support at (844) 737-8254).
